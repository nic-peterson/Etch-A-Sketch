# Etch-A-Sketch

Complete this TOP [etch-a-sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project). 

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a etch-a-sketch from a square space with an arbitrary number of X by X grids. Then the user hovers over the screen, they'll chagne the color of the grid creating an etch-a-sketch experience. 

The user can choose to clear the screen and change the grid density to allow for more granularity. 

Used Vanilla JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM.
